# Hangman
### by Ross Davis

The purpose of this application is to deploy the Hangman game in the browser.

## The rules are simple:
* Player One chooses a word and clicks 'Set Word'
* Player Two will enter letter or phrase guesses into the box and click 'Guess'
* Player will earn 5 points for each letter guessed.
* Player can keep guessing until all body parts have been displayed.
* After game is complete, a new word or phrase can be entered.

## Features:
* Score is visible in the upper left corner.
* Dead letters or words are visible in the upper right corner.
* Hover over '@' to see the dead word or phrase.
* You can guess individual letters, or the entire word or phrase.

## Technologies:
* I decided to take the Model/View approach in order to learn it.
* JavaScript and JQuery (where I wasn't forced to use standard DOM manipulation).

## Installation
1. Fork and clone the [project repsository](https://github.com/rossjdavis/hangman/tree/gh-pages")
